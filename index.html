I was once a great conqueror.
My hands bore a roaring weapon that swept nations into the seas.
My armies were masterful painters- what followed them was 
a brushstroke of blood and ash that stretched to every horizon.
But my sword arm has grown tired, and my resolve has grown weary.
Somewhere under Heaven is a master of voices.
They can ask flowers to grow from the driest desert.
They can sing a song so beautiful that it halts armies in their march.
I wish to find this person.
I wish to be inspired by them.
I wish to be convinced that swordsmen like me need not exist.
