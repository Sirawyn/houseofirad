"I WAS ONCE A GREAT CONQUEROR. 
MY HANDS BORE A ROARING WEAPON THAT SWEPT NATIONS INTO THE SEAS. 
MY ARMIES WERE MASTERFUL PAINTERS- WHAT FOLLOWED THEM WAS A BRUSHSTROKE OF BLOOD AND ASH THAT STRETCHED TO EVERY HORIZON. 
BUT MY SWORD ARM HAS GROWN TIRED, AND MY RESOLVE HAS GROWN WEARY. 
SOMEWHERE UNDER HEAVEN IS A MASTER OF VOICES. 
THEY CAN ASK FLOWERS TO GROW FROM THE DRIEST DESERT. 
THEY CAN SING A SONG SO BEAUTIFUL THAT IT HALTS ARMIES IN THEIR MARCH. 
I WISH TO FIND THIS PERSON. 
I WISH TO BE INSPIRED BY THEM. 
I WISH TO BE CONVINCED THAT SWORDSMEN LIKE ME NEED NOT EXIST."
