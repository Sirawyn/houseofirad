I was once a great conqueror.  
My hands bore a roaring weapon that swept nations into the seas.  
My armies were masterful painters—what followed them was  
a brushstroke of blood and ash that stretched to every horizon.  
But my sword arm has grown tired, and my resolve has grown weary.  
Somewhere under Heaven is a master of voices.  
They can ask flowers to grow from the driest desert.  
They can sing a song so beautiful that it halts armies in their march.  
I wish to find this person.  
I wish to be inspired by them.  
I wish to be convinced that swordsmen like me need not exist.
